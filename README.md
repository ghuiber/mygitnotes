The file timeline.txt is my running commentary from having followed Understanding Git Conceptually, a Git tutorial that looked manageable to me, here: http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/.

As I went through the various examples -- add, commit, branch, merge, etc. -- I figured I'd use my own file as test content for version control with Git, and its various commits would track my progress through the tutorial.

So, the file is not meant to be useful to others. It's barely legible. It's just the best way I could think of to learn Git both quickly and systematically. Use it at your own risk. My own guess is that you'd be better off following this tutorial yourself, and also http://learn.github.com/.
